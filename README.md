C++ Grading Program

At the start of the program, it generates a random class subject and a random list of students using the .txt files. You can then view the class roster and info by typing the command #view class. 

To create a new assignment, type the command #create assignment and the program will go through a few prompts that you will have to fill in. To view all created assignments, type the command #view assignments. Then to grade an assignment and give everyone a grade, type the command #grade assignment. The program will prompt you to enter the assignment number, which is found when you type the command #view assignments, then it will loop through the entire list of students prompting you to enter a grade for each student. Alternatively, you can use the command #enter grade which will allow you to enter a grade for an assignment for a single student. 

After creating and grading assignments, you can view a student's profile by using the command #profile. You will be prompted to enter a profile number. To find the profile number you wish to view, type #view class and the number associated with a student is the number you would enter. In each student profile, a list of their assignments and scores will be displayed, as well as their overall grade for the class.
